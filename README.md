# curlingdrawmanager
A web-based tool for creating and running a tournament/bonspiel

Introduction - years ago, I was the drawmaster for a big annual curling tournament (150+ teams, over 400
games, 15+ curling clubs over 5 days). When I took over the job, the games were being tracked in a huge
Excel spreadsheet that had multiple 'sheets' with formulas that interconnected everything, and it
was a real pain to figure out and make changes.

I'm a software developer and I had been dabbling in some primitive web development, so i started to
try writing a web-based tool for planning and tracking the draw. This had a moderate amount of
success, but have never been formally taught to be a web developer and it showed in a few rough
edges and glitches in the app. Also, the official scorekeeper for the event did not like the change,
so I had to revert to using the Excel spreadsheet in parallel.

Still, I thought it showed potential, and it was written to be generic enough that it could potentially
be used by other tournaments. It has been in storage for the last few years, but I am putting it on
github in the hopes of attracting like-minded collaborators who actually *know* some web programming.
